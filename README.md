# Simple Portfolio Site

A clean, responsive personal portfolio built with plain HTML, CSS, and JS. No build steps or dependencies required.

## Quick start

- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Or serve locally (recommended for correct relative paths and caching):
  - VS Code: use the Live Server extension
  - Python: `python -m http.server 8000`
  - Node: `npx serve . --single`

## Customize

- Update your name, bio, and links in `index.html`.
- Add project cards in the `#projects` section.
- Put images or downloads into the `assets/` folder and reference them in HTML.
- Adjust colors/spacing in `styles.css`.

## Files

- `index.html` – structure and content
- `styles.css` – layout, colors, and responsiveness
- `script.js` – mobile nav toggle, smooth scrolling preference
- `assets/` – images and static files

## Deploy

You can host this static site easily:
- GitHub Pages – push to a repo and enable Pages
- Netlify/Vercel – drag-and-drop the folder or connect the repo
